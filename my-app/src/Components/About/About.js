          Hello! I am a recent graduate from the George Washington University Full Stack Development Bootcamp. I have a passion for coding and I'm excited to start my journey in the world of Full Stack Development. I am dedicated, detail-oriented, and have a knack for problem-solving.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my bootcamp, I have gained valuable experience with a variety of technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, and React. I have developed a strong foundation in both the front-end and back-end, enabling me to build complete web applications from the ground up. I am now looking forward to applying these skills in a professional environment and further honing my abilities.
